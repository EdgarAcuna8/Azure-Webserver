## Overview

In this project, I learned and practiced:

- Azure fundamentals: Resource groups, virtual networks, subnets, network security groups, Bastion, virtual machines
- Creating VM with Ubuntu Web Server
- Connecting to VM via Bastion SSH and basic web server (Nextcloud) configuration
- Set up public IP in DNS label
- Creating/managing resources using Powershell

By the end of this project, I was able to navigate to my web server on my browser and login, by using the DNS configuration I had applied.
